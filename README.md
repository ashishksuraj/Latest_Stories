- There are 2 files in the repository, one is java file and the other one is javascript named "latest\_stories.java" and "latest\_stories.js" respectively.
- Both files are having their screenshot explanation named "java.png" and "javascript.png" respectively.

Please run the files in required IDE or in the terminal by running following command:
>For java:
```sh
javac file_name_with_correct_path; java file_name_with_correct_path(without extention)
Example: javac latest_stories.java; java latest_stories
```
followed by the input to the file as "time.com"

>For javascript: 
```sh
node file_name_with_correct_path
Example: node latest_stories.js
```
then open localhost:3000 on your favoriote web browser. "express, axios, cheerio"dependencies should be installed for javascript.
